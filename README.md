# jerzologger
i made it when i was 13, it has a LOT of bugs so don't be mad when program crashes. I don't think that i'll be working on this project anymore (friend asked me to share this code) so feel free to use / edit code 

# instalation
just download .py file and install required libraries
``` 
pip install pynput
pip install termcolor
pip install colorama
pip install schedule
```
Sometimes code won't work because it's unnable to create new directory, or you don't have WI-FI to send logs (program crashes then too) if that happens, just change log directory.
